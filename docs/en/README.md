## Overview

Ki enables simple and fast management of k8s clusters. Unlike kubectx, ki is designed to automatically switch namespaces without manual intervention, and it integrates with your terminal prompt to display the current $KUBECONFIG in real-time. This makes your k8s operations safer and more efficient, especially when managing multiple k8s clusters. With ki, you can seamlessly switch between different clusters, providing an immersive operational experience that makes k8s management "effortless" for DevOps engineers and "easy" for developers.

## Features

- Lightweight and simple, only requires Python3, master it in 10 minutes
- Fuzzy matching for $namespace, faster than auto-completion
- Auto-switch $namespace with historical analysis for intelligent switching
- Real-time terminal prompt showing current $KUBECONFIG
- Multi-cluster management, search and locate target k8s across multiple clusters
- Directory following, automatically switch $KUBECONFIG based on k8s resource directories
