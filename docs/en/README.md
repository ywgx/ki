## Overview

ki can manage k8s clusters very simply and quickly. Unlike kubectx, ki is designed to make namespace switching work automatically without manual management. It integrates with terminal prompts to display the current $KUBECONFIG in real-time, allowing you to operate k8s more safely and efficiently. Especially when managing multiple k8s clusters, using ki allows you to switch freely between various k8s clusters, providing an immersive operation experience. It enables operations personnel to manage k8s "with flying steps" and developers to use k8s "with ease".

## Features

- Simple and lightweight, only depends on Python3 basic environment, can be mastered in 10 minutes
- Most similar matching for $namespace, faster than auto-completion
- Automatic $namespace switching, records historical switching statistics and analysis, intelligent switching
- Terminal command prompt displays current $KUBECONFIG in real-time
- Multi-cluster management, search and locate target k8s among multiple clusters
- Follow-along switching, linkage with k8s resource directories, follow $KUBECONFIG switching in different k8s directories
